## Our Vision

We have put a lot of thought into how we want RondayView to move forward with features, improvements and awesomeness from start to finish with some checkpoints 
in between. We have split the app up into 3 stages and called them A1, A2 and A3, with each stage building upon the former. As such, we would like all features
of A1 to be completed before starting features of A2, and the same for A2 going to A3. I have listed these milestone features below but they are also shown in 
the Issues tab. 

For A1, we would like to cover basic functions of the app. These include the following:
* Create Events – anyone can create events initially and this is stored in database
* Browse Events – anyone can browse events
* Swipe events to show interest or disinterest
* Basic Filter - event dates, event size, virtual or in person
* Basic initial user interface
* Profiles - Local storage / Favourites

Moving to A2, we would like to build mostly upon the social aspects of the program. The features that we would like to implement are as follows:
* User profiles - Sign in, accounts stored in databases
* Able to add other user profiles as friends
* View events that friends are going to
* View popular events among all users
* Leaderboard aspect (who has visited the most events)

Finally, at A3, we would like to add features that integrate the project into other aspects of the phone, as well as further cater the app towards individual users with the following features:
* In-app and push notifications for upcoming events
* Link to the phones calendar
* Advanced Filters - Tags / event type, event host name
* Each event gets a photo album that attendees can add to
* Event rating and comments – previous events rating too
* Suggested similar events in event description
* Private Groups and private events

All of these features are detailed more in the GitHub Issues tab so you can check them out there too. Feel free to send us an email if you would like to contribute and have any questions about a feature at vroyale374@gmail.com
